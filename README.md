# TODO List App with MERN Stack

This project is a TODO List application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks in a simple and intuitive interface.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using the command `npm install`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can perform the following actions:

- Add a new task by entering it into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- Edit a task by clicking on it and making changes. Press "Enter" to save the changes.
- Mark a task as done by clicking the checkbox next to it.
- Delete a task by clicking the trash can icon next to it.

## Backend Connectivity

The backend of the application is built with Node.js and Express.js. MongoDB is used as the database to store tasks. The frontend interacts with the backend through RESTful API endpoints.

## File Structure

- `client`: Contains the React frontend code.
- `server`: Contains the Node.js backend code.
- `public`: Static assets and HTML files for the frontend.

## Dependencies

- MongoDB: The database used to store tasks.
- Express.js: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- React.js: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- Axios: HTTP client for making requests from the frontend to the backend.

## Deployment

The application is deployed locally on port 5173. To deploy it on a production server, follow the steps provided by your hosting provider.
